        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a rising sophomore at Manhattan College pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
            Even though I started learning to code in college last year, I am determined to learn more skills and become more versatile. 
            My technical skills include C++, HTML, and CSS. I excel at working with others and collaborating effectively in teams. 
            I am looking for opportunities to apply my existing knowledge and learn new skills in order to advance my career.
